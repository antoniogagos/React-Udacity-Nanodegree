# Udacity React Nanodegree

## Program Structure
The React Nanodegree program is a single-term program with a 4-month duration. The curriculum is made up of 3 courses and 3 real-world projects. The courses are React Component Model, React & Redux, and React Native.

In order to pass the program the developer needs to successfully complete all projects with a grade of “Meets Specifications” for it as set forth in the curriculum and syllabus.

After graduation, the developer will have deep knowledge in how to build declarative user interfaces for the web with React, and for iOS and Android with React Native - using Redux to manage states more predictably.
